# Waste Classification Project (Image-based)

## 📌 Description
This project is part of my Data Science & AI course.  
The goal is to classify waste images into **Organic (O)** and **Recyclable (R)** categories using Machine Learning & Deep Learning.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/` → dataset info (dataset from Kaggle/Drive)
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter/Colab notebooks (week-wise progress)
- `reports/` → Weekly reports + screenshots
- `src/` → Python scripts for preprocessing and modeling

  📑 Is file me ye libraries hain:

numpy → numerical operations
pandas → data handling
matplotlib → plotting
seaborn → advanced visualization
Pillow → image handling
scikit-learn → ML algorithms (later use)
tensorflow & keras → deep learning models (CNN etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open notebooks in Google Colab
2. Upload dataset (`archive.zip`) from Kaggle
3. Run cells step by step

## 📊 Progress
- Week 1: Setup + Dataset loaded
- Week 2: Data Cleaning (326 duplicates removed, resized images)
- Week 3: Visualization (bar charts + sample images)

## 🔗 Dataset
[Kaggle - Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data)
